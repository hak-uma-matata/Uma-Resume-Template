# Uma-Resume-Template

This is a general professional classic black and white resume template mainly designed for technical professions. Adapted from Jake's Resume (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs),
itself based on https://github.com/sb2nov/resume, a resume template created by Sourabh Bajaj.

The additions have mainly been to layout and adding icons in the header for contact information. More serif fonts have also been added that do not require font installs.
